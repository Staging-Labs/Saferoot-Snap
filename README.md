## Introducing Saferoot: Safeguard your crypto and NFTs

[Saferoot](https://www.saferoot.io/) is a pioneering **threat mitigation layer**, providing **real-time protection** for vulnerable digital assets. Our non-custodial solution intercepts dangerous transactions before being committed on-chain, redirecting pre-authorized assets to a secure **backup wallet.**

### Why Choose Saferoot?

In just the first quarter of 2022, losses in the Web3 ecosystem due to hacks and fraud amounted to $1.23 billionâ€”a staggering 695% increase from the previous year. The FTC reported that over 46,000 people lost more than $1 billion to crypto scams in 2021 alone. Saferoot stands as a robust countermeasure to this escalating problem.
